# hashing_awk
i previosuly wrote this in C++ and also in python and R but if you want to see a awk version, so you can try this. You input directory file should be a single line formatted for the same. I will check this tonight for the final version release along with the test samples. specifically wrote for a project but can be implemented on anything. extracts using the ```substr``` and dont even have to cache load the file and it read io directly. 

run the protein alignments as
```
 miniprot --gff genome.fasta rotein.fasta > alingment.gff
```
